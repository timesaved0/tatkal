                        Most of the operators provides KMs based pricing inclusive of driver allowance, ignoring the dynamic major costs (hidden cost) involved like Tolls, Parking fees and State taxes. We, at Tatkal Taxi provides the transparency in costing with detailed breakups to client for assuring fixed cost services.
